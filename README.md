## üí° Why I Built This

I built SecureGen to create a practical, full-stack application that addresses a real-world security need. The goal was to demonstrate a deep understanding of modern web development concepts, including secure authentication, real-time database interactions, global state management with React Context, and protected client-side routing.

---

## üß± Challenges & Lessons

- Integrating a secure and seamless authentication flow with Firebase Auth.
- Setting up real-time data synchronization using Firestore's `onSnapshot` listener.
- Managing global loading and authentication states to prevent UI flicker and race conditions.
- Implementing client-side route protection to guard user-specific data.
- Designing a unified form component to handle both "create" and "update" logic for passwords.

---

## üß† What I Learned

- The power of Firebase as a Backend-as-a-Service for rapid development of secure, real-time applications.
- How to effectively manage global state across a React application using the Context API.
- Advanced React Hook patterns, including `useEffect` for managing side effects and subscriptions, and `useCallback` for performance optimization.
- The importance of separating concerns by centralizing all backend communication in a dedicated configuration file.
- Efficient and declarative form handling using the `react-hook-form` library.

## üóÇÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **React** (with React Router & React Hook Form)
- **Firebase** (for Authentication & Firestore Database)
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Vite** for the build tool
- Deployed on **Vercel**

## üì¶ Future Enhancements

- Password strength indicator during creation.
- Ability to organize passwords into folders or categories.
- Two-factor authentication (2FA) for enhanced security.
- End-to-end encryption for passwords before storing them in the database.

## üìÅ Project Setup

Clone the repo and run locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/the-ajay-panigrahi/secure-gen
cd secure-gen
npm install
# note: create a .env file and add your Firebase project keys
npm run dev
```

You will need to create a .env file in the root and add your Firebase credentials like this:

```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=YOUR_APP_ID
```
